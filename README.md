GeoGuess iOS Project
====================

This was a smaller 24-hour challenge that I used to recreate a popular web browser game on the iPhone. It was never released to the AppStore or fully tested, but I thought it might be a good starting point for anyone who might want to finish the project.


Basic Idea
==========
GeoGuesser will load up a random street view and ask you to guess your coordinates by placing a pin on a map. The user can use contextual clues such as languages, road signs, license plates, and what side of the road cars may be driving on to help make an educated guess. Once you think you have an idea of where your camera is, you can tap on the NavigationBar to drop down the world map. After making a guess, it will give you the distance between your guess and the actual location and score your points. This feature could use some work but has the general functionality completed.

Future Improvements
===================
Currently, the lat/long file stores a long list of randomly generated coordinates within the range of Google StreetView. This was a short sighted solution based on Google's random coverage for many countries outside of North America. I never finished collecting all of the area's coordinates, but feel free to submit a pull request if you want to add some more in.
